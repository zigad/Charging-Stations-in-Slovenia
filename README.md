# Charging Stations in Slovenia

This project collects and updates data on electric vehicle charging stations in Slovenia. It fetches data from multiple
providers, compares it with previous data, and sends an email with new chargers when changes are detected. The application
runs on **Quarkus** and stores data in **PostgreSQL**.

## Features

- Compares with previous dataset
- Sends an email with new charging station for each provider
- Runs in **Quarkus** with **Docker** and **Flyway migrations**
